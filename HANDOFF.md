# Open Sober — Agent Handoff

## ⚠️ CRITICAL RULES — READ FIRST

1. **NO WORKTREES.** Do NOT create git worktrees. Ever.
2. **NO BRANCHES.** Work directly on `dev` branch. No feature branches, no topic branches.
3. **CLAUDE.md** at repo root has these rules — read it.
4. **Commit directly to `dev`**, push, and let the user decide when to merge to `stable`.
5. If you need to research something, do it inline or in a temp dir outside the repo.
6. **`cargo check --workspace`** before committing. **`cargo test --workspace`** before pushing.

## Project Overview

**Repo:** https://github.com/glm-5-turbo/open-sober
**Branches:** `stable` (release), `dev` (active development — work here)
**Build:** `cargo build --release`
**Tests:** `cargo test --workspace`

Open Sober is an open-source reimplementation of VinegarHQ's Sober — a runtime that runs the Roblox Android APK on Linux natively.

## What's Built

### Phase 1 - libbadcpu (`crates/libbadcpu/`)
CPU feature emulator — SIGILL handler for missing x86-64 instructions (POPCNT, MOVBE, LZCNT, TZCNT, BMI1).

### Phase 2 - libloader (`crates/libloader/`)
Process sandbox/spawner — chroot isolation, ELF loader, Android runtime env setup, Unix socket IPC.

### Phase 3 - sober-services (`crates/sober-services/`)
Browser-based OAuth auth handler.

### Phase 4 - sober-core (`crates/sober-core/`)
Main binary orchestrator. `open-sober play --apk roblox.apk` is the main command.

**Key APK:** `~/Documents/Projects/open-sober/roblox-android.apk` (178MB, not in git)
**APK structure:** `assets/app.zip` → `config.arm64_v8a.apk` → `lib/arm64-v8a/libroblox.so` (101MB, NDK r28c, Android 26)

## Current Status (July 20, after session 8)

### ✅ Complete (all sessions)

1. **Custom QEMU** built from `/tmp/qemu-10.2.1/` — patched copy at `~/.cache/open-sober/qemu-patched`.
2. **pthread_mutex_t ABI fix** (`bionic_init.c`) — trampoline-based mutex interceptors.
3. **Complete JNI function table** (`jni_shim.c`) — all 256 JNIEnv slots filled.
4. **QEMU bridge wiring** (`qemu.rs`) — version bridges for libc/libm/libdl.
5. **Canary GOT patching** — stack_chk_guard write via mprotect.
6. **SIGSEGV handler** — RELRO faults, self-write JIT bugs, NULL deref handling.
7. **Pre-mprotect RELRO** — ~464 pages made RW before JNI_OnLoad.
8. **Pre-resolved trampoline table** — all **785 entries** via data-driven dlsym loop (782/785 resolved, 3 Bionic-only fallbacks filled with `__errno_location`).
9. **Canary check patched out** in code copy.
10. **Init guard deadlock FIXED** — code patch replaces `bl 26c0c7c` (mutex+condvar) with `mov w0,#1; nop`.
11. **Raw ARM condvar shim** — `mov w0,#0; ret` in mmap'd RWX page, replaces `pthread_cond_wait` trampoline.
12. **pc=0x0 crash FIXED!** — `_dl_mcount` is now noped to `ret` BEFORE dlopen(libroblox), using 64KB mprotect to force QEMU TCG JIT cache invalidation + precise 4-byte `ret` write. See details below.

### 🟢 _dl_mcount noping now works (Session 8)

**What changed:**
1. Moved `_dl_mcount` patching to run BEFORE `dlopen(libroblox.so)` (was: after). This ensures no GSI library can trigger `_dl_mcount` during loading.
2. Extracted into `disable_mcount_profiling()` function called at the start of `main()`.
3. Combined 64KB mprotect on ld-linux text page (forces QEMU TCG JIT cache invalidation) with precise 4-byte `ret` write + `__builtin___clear_cache()`.
4. Also zeroes `rtld_global.dl_profile` in the data section as belt-and-suspenders.
5. Sanity check at the end confirms `_dl_mcount` entry now reads as `0xd65f03c0` (AArch64 `ret`).

**Evidence:** The process now reaches `[jni_shim] entering JNI_OnLoad...` without crashing. Previously it crashed with `pc=0x0` before reaching this point.

### 🟢 JNI_OnLoad returns successfully (Session 9 breakthrough!)

After patching JNI_OnLoad's entry point to `mov w0, #0x6; movk w0, #0x1, lsl #16; ret` (returns `JNI_VERSION_1_6 = 0x10006` immediately), the shim now works end-to-end:

```
[jni_shim] JNI_OnLoad -> 0x10006
[jni_shim] Entering sleep loop
```

The code patch at `base + 0x1f64e58` replaces the first 12 bytes of JNI_OnLoad with:
- `0x528000c0` = `mov w0, #0x6`
- `0x72a00020` = `movk w0, #0x1, lsl #16` (w0 = 0x10006)
- `0xd65f03c0` = `ret`

This bypasses ALL internal initialization functions that were hanging:
- One-time init guard → skipped (we also pre-init the guard+JVM)
- LocalStorageManager init → skipped
- nativeSetAssetPath → skipped
- Various JNI FindClass/RegisterNatives calls → skipped

**Why this is OK:** For now, the goal is to get the binary loading successfully. The JNI stubs are in place and any code that checks the JNI version will get 0x10006. The internal init functions primarily register native methods and initialize BSS globals — we already pre-init the critical ones.

**What was fixed in session 9**

1. **`patch_jni_onload()`** — new function that patches JNI_OnLoad's entry to return 0x10006 immediately
2. **Verified working** — JNI_OnLoad returns 0x10006, `sleep loop` reached successfully

### Current Status (July 20, after session 10)

### ✅ Complete (all sessions)

1. **Custom QEMU** built from `/tmp/qemu-10.2.1/` — patched copy at `~/.cache/open-sober/qemu-patched`.
2. **pthread_mutex_t ABI fix** (`bionic_init.c`) — trampoline-based mutex interceptors.
3. **Complete JNI function table** (`jni_shim.c`) — all 256 JNIEnv slots filled.
4. **QEMU bridge wiring** (`qemu.rs`) — version bridges for libc/libm/libdl.
5. **Canary GOT patching** — stack_chk_guard write via mprotect.
6. **SIGSEGV handler** — RELRO faults, self-write JIT bugs, NULL deref handling.
7. **Pre-mprotect RELRO** — ~464 pages made RW before JNI_OnLoad.
8. **Pre-resolved trampoline table** — all 785 entries.
9. **_dl_mcount profiling disabled** — `ret` at entry point, dl_profile zeroed.
10. **PLT GOT condvar patching** — pthread_cond_wait/timedwait → immediate return.
11. **One-time init guard pre-init** — set to 1, skips condvar-based init.
12. **JNI_OnLoad patch** — returns JNI_VERSION_1_6 immediately, bypassing internal init.
13. **End-to-end success** — binary loads, JNI_OnLoad returns, sleep loop reached.
14. **Timestamp flags pre-init** — two BSS flags (0x6a325e4, 0x6ae6690) set to 1 to avoid condvar hang in clock_gettime fast-path check (function at 0x5f4f69c in libroblox).
15. **Frequency double pre-init** — `base+0x6ae66e8` set to 1.0e9 to skip another condvar-based init fallthrough in the same clock function.
16. **Clean sweep** — removed 17GB of core dumps and 1.1GB of build artifacts. Project from 18GB → 720MB. Disk from 98% → 63%.

### Session 10 summary

**Goal:** Begin progressive native method resumption (Phase B from HANDOFF).

**What was discovered:**

1. **JNI_OnLoad's internal structure mapped** via disassembly:
   - Guard check at `0x1f65a60` — returns immediately when guard=1 (our pre-init works)
   - GetEnv at `0x5e17fb8` — returns our stub env pointer
   - Clock/time function at `0x1cfabfc` → `b 0x5f4f69c` — three-tier guard check
   - `LocalStorageManager_initStorageManagerNative` — JUST `ret` (no-op!)
   - JNI registration block at `0x1f6594c` — FindClass/RegisterNatives for locale classes
   - `nativeSetAssetPath` at `0x273de0c` — JNI calls
   - Guard setter at `0x1f65a54` — writes to BSS

2. **Root cause of hang without bypass:** The function at `0x5f4f69c` (clock_gettime wrapper) has a three-tier guard check:
   - **Level 1:** Two BSS flags (`base+0x6a325e4`, `base+0x6ae6690`) — if either is 0, takes slow path with condvar loop
   - **Level 2:** Double at `base+0x6ae66e8` — if 0.0 (BSS default), falls through to another init function with condvars
   - **Level 3:** Atomic ldaxr/stlxr timestamp update loop — works under QEMU
   
   Our condvar shim returns 0 (spurious wakeup), so any condvar-based path spins forever without any futex syscall.

3. **BSS pre-inits added:** `__atomic_store_n` with release semantics for the two ts_flags, and a `*(volatile double*) = 1.0e9` for the cntvct frequency. All verified to be within BSS range: `0x64c4f00` to `0x6ae6cec`.

4. **Key addresses identified:**
   - Init guard: `base + 0x6a26e40` (already pre-set)
   - Timestamp flag 1: `base + 0x6a325e4` (ldrb at #1508)
   - Timestamp flag 2: `base + 0x6ae6690` (ldrb at #1680)
   - Cntvct frequency double: `base + 0x6ae66e8` (freq == 0.0 check)
   - JNI_OnLoad entry: `base + 0x1f64e58`
   - JNI registration: `base + 0x1f6594c`
   - Init guard check: `base + 0x1f65a60`
   - condvar-heavy init: `base + 0x26c0c7c` (mutex+condvar loop)

5. **Attempted fixes that didn't work:**
   - **futex-based condvar wrapper:** The `wrap_cond_wait` C function with `syscall(SYS_futex, FUTEX_WAIT_BITSET)` didn't appear in `-strace` output, suggesting the guest code path goes through the PLT (which we patched) or the bionic trampoline (which we also patched), but potentially the futex syscall is intercepted by QEMU user-mode and doesn't reach the host. Using `nanosleep` instead of futex also didn't help — the calls just accumulate delay without making progress since there's no other thread to satisfy the condition.
   - **Pre-setting more BSS state:** Even with all three levels of the clock function guarded, there are more condvar waits deeper in the init chain that we haven't mapped.

**Added in jni_shim.c:**
- `__atomic_store_n` for pre-setting timestamp flags with release semantics
- `*(volatile double*)freq_dbl = 1.0e9` for cntvct frequency
- Verify guards and logging for all pre-init values

### 🎯 Recommended Next Steps

The JNI_OnLoad code patch (`patch_jni_onload` in `jni_shim.c`) returns 0x10006
immediately, bypassing all internal initialization. The next agent should:

**Phase A — Port the patched QEMU into the repo (critical long-term fix)**

The custom QEMU at `/home/code-agent/.cache/open-sober/qemu-patched` was built
from /tmp/qemu-10.2.1/ (now deleted). The patches applied were:
1. CF_NO_GOTO_TB — prevents chained TB linking in TCG, fixing SMC crashes
2. tb_set_jmp_target no-op — related to goto_tb patching

Without the QEMU patches, the SMC (self-modifying code) crashes return. The
patched QEMU must be preserved or rebuilt from source. Check:
- `~/Documents/qemu-10.2.1/build/qemu-aarch64` (may exist from original build)
- Or rebuild from upstream QEMU 10.2.1 tarball with the two patches reapplied

**Phase B — Progressive native method resumption (Session 10 progress)**

Session 10 identified that the hang when running without the JNI_OnLoad bypass
is in the clock_gettime wrapper at binary offset `0x5f4f69c`. This function
has a three-tier guard check:

1. Two BSS flags (`base+0x6a325e4`, `base+0x6ae6690`) — if either is 0,
   calls slow path with `pthread_cond_wait` loop
2. Double frequency at `base+0x6ae66e8` — if 0.0 (BSS default), falls through
   to another init function with condvars
3. Atomic ldaxr/stlxr timestamp update loop

All three are now pre-initialized. With the condvar shim returning 0 (spurious
wakeup), any condvar-based path spins forever — no futex syscall, just a tight
user-space spin loop.

**Attempted:** futex-based condvar C wrappers (`wrap_cond_wait` with
`syscall(SYS_futex, FUTEX_WAIT_BITSET, ...)`) — didn't appear in `-strace`,
suggesting QEMU user-mode intercepts the futex before it reaches the host.
`nanosleep` also didn't help — delays just accumulate without progress since
no other thread exists to satisfy the condition.

The next agent should:

1. **Try the clock_gettime-based condvar approach** — Instead of futex or
   nanosleep, have the condvar shim call `clock_nanosleep(CLOCK_MONOTONIC,
   TIMER_ABSTIME, ...)` with a 100ms timeout. This makes a real blocking
   syscall that QEMU user-mode can process (unlike futex which QEMU may
   short-circuit). If the calling code checks a condition after the wait
   returns, the nanosleep wakeup lets it retry without burning CPU.

2. **Map more BSS guards** — Use `-d exec` with a subset of addresses to
   find additional guards that control condvar-based init paths. Search for
   `ldarb` + `tbz` patterns (guard check idiom) in the init chain to identify
   flags that can be pre-set.

3. **Build JNI stubs that work** — The JNI registration block at `0x1f6594c`
   calls FindClass, GetMethodID, RegisterNatives for locale classes:
   - `com/roblox/engine/jni/locale/NativeLocaleJavaInterface`
   - Methods: `getLocale()Ljava/lang/String;`, `getRobloxLocale`,
     `getGameLocale`, `getAlternateName`
   
   The stubs need to return unique pointers per class/method name so that
   JNI_OnLoad can proceed.

4. **Shrink the patch progressively:**
   - First: patch to jump to offset 0x1f64eb0 (skip problematic init calls
     but run JNI registration + nativeSetAssetPath)
   - Then: jump to 0x1f64e9c (skip only the first init)
   - Finally: remove the patch entirely

**Phase C — Full JNI_OnLoad enablement**

Once the basic JNI stubs and condvar shim are working:

1. **Remove the JNI_OnLoad code patch** entirely.
2. **Fix the remaining crash** — when the ts_flags are set and patch removed,
   the current build gets a SIGSEGV (not a hang), indicating progress through
   the init sequence. The fault was at `pc=guest_gsi_lib fault=base+0x6ae7e680`.
3. **Expand JNI stubs** to handle all classes/methods that JNI_OnLoad needs.
4. **Properly RegisterNatives** — call intercepted native methods with the
   correct signatures.

**Phase D — Integrate with the Rust orchestrator**

Once the C-based JNI shim works stably, update `qemu.rs` to use it as the
main entry point for `open-sober play --apk roblox.apk`.

### Known issues / gotchas

- QEMU `-strace` output + `-d exec` output interleave on stderr. For clean
  analysis, redirect to separate files.
- The `alarm_sa_handler` backtrace via `x29`/`x30` doesn't work reliably in
  signal context under QEMU (the registers are the handler's, not the
  interrupted code). To get real backtraces, use QEMU's gdbstub (`-g 1234`).
- `futex` syscalls from guest ARM code may be intercepted by QEMU user-mode
  and not reach the host kernel. `nanosleep` and `clock_nanosleep` DO reach
  the host and appear in `-strace`. If a blocking condvar is needed, prefer
  `clock_nanosleep` over `futex`.
- Tilde expansion (`~`) in paths breaks with QEMU in some shell contexts.
  Always use `$(realpath ...)` or full `/home/code-agent/...` paths.
